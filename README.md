# SqlAlchemy  

**It was a very interesting challenge, but unfortunately I couldn´t complete all the Bonus part.**

# Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
This part is complete in the Jupyter Notebook *"climate_starter.ipynb"* it was interesting do the engine, the reflect and  automap to use the data and then continue practice all the knowledge before using pandas and matplotlib.

# Step 2 - Climate App
Even it was the most hard part, It was interesting doing all the routes and def´s in *"app.py"*, even look simple it takes me a lot of time to complete and also return to the knowledge before about JSON. 

This is the list of the routes that are in the Main Route:

/api/v1.0/precipitation

/api/v1.0/stations

/api/v1.0/tobs

/api/v1.0/

/api/v1.0//

For check the last two routes is necessary complete with a start date and end date  or just a start date as parameter.
for example: 

http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2011-02-28/2011-03-05

http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1.0/2011-02-28
